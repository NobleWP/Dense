Git commands I've learned so far -

1#git status
--presents the local repo status of files that are added, or to be added or to be commited....

2#git add --all
-- adds everything in the local repo to the "stage" that is to be commited.

3#git commit -m "summary for the commit"
-- actual changes in the repo are "saved" completely with this command, -m stands for -message

4#(git config --global user.email "you@example.com") -- ( git config --global user.name "Your Name")
-- these two commands are essential to commit, if not the 3# command will through an error. (--global) is optional, if omitted, user details are limited to that local repo only. enter the above two commands separately !!

5#git remote -v
-- check to see whether this local repo has any remote repos linkes to it

6#git remote add <ALIAS> <URL>
-- to add a new remote; point to remember local repo is named as "master" and remote repo is "origin" by default, though we can assign any desired name for remote repo. <url> in format of "https://github.com/user/repo.git".
-- examples : git remote add origin https://github.com/myusername/myreponame.git
                        git remote add destination https://github.com/myusername/myreponame.git

7#git push  <REMOTENAME> <BRANCHNAME> 
--simply pushes all your local repo files to the remote repo(only if ther are any changes and u should have write permission to the remote). It checks the write permission by asking ur remote repo username and password, then preceeds to pushing.
-- example: git push origin master
